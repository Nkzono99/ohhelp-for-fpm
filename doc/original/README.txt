This package provides you with source files of OhHelp library for
scalable domain-decomposed Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations.  To
know what this package provides, how to use library functions and how
to "make" them with your PIC code, please read the manual included in
the package and named "ohhelp-man.pdf".

The following list of files is just for confirming that you have
obtained and extracted the files correctly.
